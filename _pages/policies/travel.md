# Traveling to HackCU

How do you get to HackCU?

## Location and Parking

The main event will be located in the SEEC building at:

>4001 Discovery Dr
> 
>Boulder, CO 80303 

Parking will be available in the parking lot outside of SEEC on Discovery Dr. Be sure to follow directions on the signs to make sure you are not in permit only parking.

## Flying in

You should look for flights to Denver International Airport (DIA). From there you can take a bus, the RTD AB line, that runs from the airport to our university campus. Find the bus schedule and fares [here](http://www3.rtd-denver.com/schedules/getSchedule.action?routeId=AB). Buy tickets using [RTD Mobile Ticket app](http://www.rtd-denver.com/mobileticket.shtml) or bring cash to pay directly to the driver (cost is 9$ either way). Keep your bus receipts so we can reimburse you later if you were approved.

## International Travel

We love international participants! Check the [ESTA website](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/) to see if you are applicable. If you need a visa we can provide you with a signed invitation letter for your visa. The rest of the arrangements must be done on your own.

# Booking your travel

If you are traveling via flight, Amtrak, or public bus, you will have **7 days to RSVP** and upload your receipts and forms from the day you receive your reimbursement email. **After this period, we cannot guarantee admission and will not increase your travel cap.** 

## Dates and time

You should anticipate arriving by **8 AM Saturday, February 24th** and leaving after **5 PM on Sunday, February 25th**.

# Staying Friday and/or Sunday night

If you cannot book travel for Sunday night and want to leave on Monday morning, please try and arrange to stay with a CU friend on campus. We can try and help you arrange somewhere to stay, but cannot guarantee availability.

# Travel reimbursement

## Amount

We will be offering flight reimbursements on a first come first serve basis with the amount reimbursed affected by current prices for flights to DEN airport. Once approved by our admin team via email, you will be required to submit travel receipts on our travel reimbursement form. Your entire flight may or may not be covered by reimbursements. We have a limited budget, we would like to reimburse everyone, but it's just not feasible. 

If you research transportation from your location and find the travel cap to be unreasonable, feel free to contest it with us by emailing [contact@hackcu.org](mailto:contact@hackcu.org).

## Reimbursement method
- If you live in the US, we can reimburse you with either Venmo or Paypal. Fill an option while submitting your receipt
- Otherwise, if your country doesn't have Venmo, we will be sending out reimbursements via Paypal.
- Please note that this our only 2 options. Both services are free, so we kindly ask you to sign up to either one of those. 
- If you can't sign up to either please send us an email at [contact@hackcu.org](mailto:contact@hackcu.org).
