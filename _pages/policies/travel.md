## Location and Parking

The main event will be located in the SEEC building at:

>4001 Discovery Dr
> 
>Boulder, CO 80303 

Parking will be available in the parking lot outside of SEEC on Discovery Drive. Be sure to follow directions on the signs so you don't park in permit only parking.

## Flying in

You should book flights into Denver International Airport (DEN). From there you can take the AB line that runs from the airport directly to campus. The bus schedule and fares can be found [here](http://www3.rtd-denver.com/schedules/getSchedule.action?routeId=AB). You can buy tickets at the airport, paying directly to the driver with cash, or through the [RTD Mobile Ticket app](http://www.rtd-denver.com/mobileticket.shtml). Also, make sure to bring $9.00 cash for the bus ride back to the airport as there are no ticket machines where you can pay with card near our campus. Keep your bus receipts so we can reimburse you later if you were approved for reimbursement.

## International Travel

We love international participants! Check the [ESTA website](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/) to see if you are applicable. If you need a visa we can provide you with a signed invitation letter for your visa. The rest of the arrangements must be made on your own.
