### Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression,
age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
nationality, or religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption
of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out
from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their
request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable
expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

As this is a hackathon related event, we like to explicitly note that the hacks or projects created at our hackathon are
equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.

Sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors
should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives
(including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create
 a sexualised environment.
 
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately.

Event staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law
enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for
the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organisers may take any action they
deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the event with no
refund (if applicable), or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.

We expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues and
hackathon-related social events.
