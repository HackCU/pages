First of all, in the name of the HackCU team, we’d like to thank you all for wanting to be a judge. Your decision will be crucial to be able to determine, fairly, whose projects should be awarded.

## When to arrive

>SEEC Building, 4001 Discovery Dr
>Boulder, CO 80303

Judges are expected to arrive at 10:00 AM. Upon arrival check in with a volunteer or organizer. They will give you directions on where the judging meeting will be. 

As a judge you will be briefed at 10:30 AM as a group about how will the expo work and how to find projects and evaluate them.

Judging will take place from 12:30 PM to 2:30 PM. It will be following a science fair project presentation style. More details on the format will be shared during the morning briefing.

## Judging criteria

Because complete fairness is difficult to achieve, we have tried to establish a few guidelines that we’d like you to follow. Please, keep in mind that the quality of the pitch/presentation of the project is not what matters. Some of the hackers may also be good sellers, that’s why we need to see through that and judge the very foundations of their projects.

That being said, the teams will be judged on the following four criteria, all of them having the same weight. Participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their project. If they missed any aspect, don’t hesitate to ask them about it.

### Technology
- How technically impressive was the hack?
- Was the technical problem that the team tackled difficult?
- Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components?
- Did the technology involved make you go "Wow"?

### Design
- Did the team put thought into the user experience?
- How well designed is the interface? For a website, this might be about how beautiful the CSS or graphics are. For a hardware project, it might be more about how good the human-computer interaction is (e.g. is it easy to use or does it use a cool interface?).

### Completion:
- Does the hack work?
- Did the team achieve everything they wanted?
- What roadblocks did they find on the way?

### Learning
- Did the team stretch themselves?
- Did they try to learn something new?
- What kind of projects have they worked on before? If a team which always does virtual reality projects decides to switch up and try doing a mobile app instead, that exploration should be rewarded.

These criteria should guide you on making the best decisions, but ultimately you are free to trust your gut feeling.
