## Tracks

If you are interested in judging a specific track, please email <b>[kyle@hackcu.org](mailto:kyle@hackcu.org)</b> or <b>[priyanka@hackcu.org](mailto:kayla@hackcu.org)</b>. Otherwise, we will randomly assign judges to certain tracks the day-of judging. 

### General
HackCU’s general challenge includes 1st, 2nd, and 3rd prize winners. This challenge will be evaluated based on the overall creativity of the team and their project, questions selected by HackCU organizers, as well as any additional criteria mandated by the judges.

### All Beginner
Hackathons are a great way for beginners in technology--from the workshops to software resources provided by HackCU, we want first-time hackers to learn and build a project first hand. This track will assess the best hack created by a team of all beginner hackers.

### Best UX/UI
As crucial as the technology behind a project is, for the best engagement from users it is necessary to have a good user interface that not only fits the needs of the user but also enhances their experience. The track will be judged based on the aesthetic nature of the project’s user design, as well as how effectively it amplifies the purpose of the project.

### Social Impact
Technology is a powerful tool that allows us to identify and combat real-world problems that billions of people face around the world today. This track will be assessed based on the project’s ability to propose a resolution for a social issue.

### Games, Music, & Entertainment
Itching to bring your game ideas to life? Have the next great entertainment app idea? Want to design your own custom music platform? Then the Games, Music, and Entertainment track is for you! Let your creative energy flow as you participate in this awesome track! The track will be judged on the project's innocative and creative nature.
