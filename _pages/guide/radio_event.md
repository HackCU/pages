## What is KØH?

KØH is a special event amateur radio station commemorating the HackCU V hackathon.  KØH is intended to introduce HackCU participants and visitors to the world of amateur radio.

## What is Amateur Radio?
Amateur radio (also known as ham radio) is a popular hobby and service that brings people, electronics and communication together. People use amateur radio to talk across town, around the world, or even into space.  It's fun, social, educational, and can be a lifeline during times of need.

Although amateur radio operators get involved for many reasons, they all have in common a basic knowledge of radio technology and operating principles, and pass an examination for a license issued by the Federal Communications Commission.  This license enables them to use radio frequencies to reach out to the world and beyond.  You do not need to learn Morse code to earn an amateur radio license.

## What Can Amateur Radio Operators Do?
You can communicate from the top of a mountain, your home or behind the wheel of your car.  In times of disaster, when the cell phone network and other regular communications channels fail, amateur radio operators can swing into action assisting emergency communications efforts and working with public service agencies.

Some amateurs use a microphone, while others interface radios with computers and the Internet to exchange audio, data, text, or images.  You can contact astronauts aboard the International Space Station, other amateurs through satellites in space, or bounce signals off the moon and back to Earth!
Many amateurs like to build and experiment with electronics.  Computer hobbyists enjoy using amateur radio's digital communications opportunities. Others compete in "DX contests," where the object is to see how many amateurs in distant locations they can contact.  Amateur radio is used mostly to form friendships and share common interests over the air or through participation in one of more than 2,000 amateur radio clubs throughout the country. There are over 600,000 radio amateurs in the United States and over 2,000,000 worldwide.

## What's Happening Today At  KØH?
We're demonstrating software defined radio (SDR), a combination of radio, computer, and Internet technology.  We also have a low power FM voice station designed for local communication, commonly used when working with public service agencies.  These are two small examples of what can be done with amateur radio.

## What Does “KØH” Mean Anyway?
All amateur radio operators are issued a unique callsign which identifies their station.  KØH is a special event callsign authorized specifically for HackCU V.  The “H” stands for “hack”.

## How Do I Learn More?
