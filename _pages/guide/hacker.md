Hello, Hacker!

The HackCU team hopes to provide you with the resources, space, and time to create something amazing. Reminder: There is <b>NO sleeping at the venue </b>. If you plan to sleep, please remember you have to find other accommodations for this. We do not have an alternative venue for people to stay at under the sleeping policy. Also, due to venue capacities in light of COVID, we will only be admitting the <b>FIRST</b> 250 hackers into the space.

The JSCBB lot #543 is located on the northwest corner of the building (refer to the map below). Parking in the JSCBB lots is not available for free (unless you have an existing permit for any of those lots). 

Please make other arrangements to get to JSBB on East Campus for 2 days. Carpool with friends and team members if you can! 

If necessary, the HackCU team is providing parking permits for those specific lots, and you can sign up for one here (we have a limited quantity, so permits are given on a first come first serve basis!) 

You must get a permit via [CU parking services](https://cuboulder.pmreserve.com) with the permit code <b>HACK8402</b>. This permit code allows you to get the pass for free. You must do this for both days. Make sure to print out the pass and put it on your vehicle while parking!
