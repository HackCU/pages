## Before the event

- Laptop, Phone, Chargers, and Other Devices - Don't forget to bring your chargers and extra batteries for any device you'll be using. 
- Headphones 
- Warm Clothes & Layers - Boulder can get very cold in February! 
- Toiletries - We'll be providing you with the essentials (toothpaste, toothbrush, floss, facial wipes). Please  bring any additional items, medications, etc. you may need. 
- Comfortable/spare clothes - If the weather permits, we have a few outdoor events planned. 
- Notebook/ Paper & Pen 
- You may bring a pillow/blanket if you'd like


### Directions :round_pushpin:

HackCU IV will take place Saturday, February 24th to Sunday February 25th, 2018 at the **SEEC** building at the University of Colorado Boulder, [4001 Discovery Dr, Boulder, CO 80303](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//40.0097787,-105.2424016/@40.0097782,-105.2464652,16z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e2). 

If you're flying into [DEN](https://www.flydenver.com/), we recommend using public transportation from the airport to get to the venue. From the airport, take the [AB line](http://www3.rtd-denver.com/schedules/getSchedule.action?runboardId=2431&routeId=AB&routeType=9&&direction=W-Bound&serviceType=1#day) (Westbound) Downtown Boulder Station line and get off at the Broadway & Euclid stop near the University of Colorado Boulderâ€” it only costs $9.00 each way. 

Parking will be available in the parking lot outside of SEEC on Discovery Drive. Be sure to follow directions on the signs indicating where you can park.

**TODO: include info about buses from main campus to SEEC**

Make sure to check the extensive [travel guide](https://pages.hackcu.org/policies/travel/) for more information about other modes of transportation, reimbursements, etc.

Almost all of our events will take place in the SEEC building. We'll have volunteers and organizers help lead you to our other event locations.
