### Directions :round_pushpin:

HackCU IV will take place Saturday, February 24th to Sunday February 25th, 2018 at the **SEEC** building at the University of Colorado Boulder, [4001 Discovery Dr, Boulder, CO 80303](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//40.0097787,-105.2424016/@40.0097782,-105.2464652,16z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e2). 

If you're flying into [DEN](https://www.flydenver.com/), we recommend using public transportation from the airport to get to the venue. From the airport, take the [AB line](http://www3.rtd-denver.com/schedules/getSchedule.action?runboardId=2431&routeId=AB&routeType=9&&direction=W-Bound&serviceType=1#day) (Westbound) Downtown Boulder Station line and get off at the **Broadway & Euclid** stop near the University of Colorado Boulder— it only costs $9.00 each way. Once there, go to [Lot 204](https://goo.gl/maps/qT5msk6QzBL2) to take our mini bus to the venue.

Make sure to check the extensive [travel guide](https://pages.hackcu.org/policies/travel/) for more information about other modes of transportation, reimbursements, etc.

Almost all of our events will take place in the SEEC building. We'll have volunteers and organizers help lead you to our other event locations.

## During the Event

### Rules :point_left:

**The #1 rule is "Be respectful"**.

Please read [HackCU's code of conduct](https://my.hackcu.org/code_conduct/) and [MLH's code of conduct](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf). We require all hackers to abide by these rules. 

### Hacking :bulb:

**No coding is allowed before 12:00 PM on Saturday**
You can hack freely in the SEEC building in rooms marked “Hacker Space.” Some classrooms will be closed for HackCU side events.

You must come with fresh code. Nothing but open source libraries or empty files to begin. Version control repos and honor system are the standards for measurement.

### Hardware :wrench:

MLH will bring their awesome hardware lab, including Oculus Rift, Leap Motion, Amazon Echo, Muse headband and a lot more! Stay tuned to the live page for the complete list of hardware available for you.
