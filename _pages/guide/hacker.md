The HackCU team hopes to provide you with the resources, space, and time to create something amazing. Reminder: There is <b>NO sleeping at the venue </b>. If you plan to sleep, please remember you have to find other accommodations for this. We do not have an alternative venue for people to stay at under the sleeping policy. Also, due to venue capacities, we will only be admitting the <b>FIRST</b> 420 hackers into the space.
