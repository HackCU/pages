# Hacker Guide
Firstly, the HackCU team welcomes you to our fourth episode of hackathons! We want you to have a great time here and make it a memorable experience for you. We want you to go back home with the feeling that you learnt something new and met some cool people. So, we put together this guide for you.<br>
This is the extensive guide to make your experience at HackCU IV nothing but amazing!

<hr/>

## Before the event

<hr/>

### What to bring

- **Valid ID** - We will need this in order to check you in. Your school ID or driver's license should suffice.
- Toiletries - We will provide most toiletries, but feel free to bring a toothbrush and maybe some toothpaste
- Laptop and Phone - Don't forget to bring your chargers. Feel free to bring extra battery packs.
- Sleep? - Though not necessary, we recommend you bring a pillow/blanket

### If you are traveling

If you're flying into [DEN](https://www.flydenver.com/), there are several ways to get to campus.

The first method is to take public transportation, aka the [AB line](http://www3.rtd-denver.com/schedules/getSchedule.action?runboardId=2431&routeType=9&routeId=AB&serviceType=3). It only costs $9.00 each way and gets to campus almost as fast a car would. From the airport, you will be traveling Westbound.

Make sure to check the extensive [travel guide](https://pages.hackcu.org/policies/travel/) for more information about other modes of transportation, reimbursements, etc.

### Rules
The #1 rule is "Be respectful".

Read our entire [code of conduct](https://my.hackcu.org/code_conduct/). We require all hackers to read and adhere to this. Violation of the code of conduct is instant grounds for diqualification.
