---

HackCU is thrilled to have you help out this year at HackCU 8! This event would not be complete without you. As a mentor, you will be helping students work on projects, learn all about a new technology, or come up with creative ideas. Participants will then have 12 hours to work on any project they choose. HackCU gives participants the resources, space, and time to create something amazing. 


## Who is a mentor?

Mentors are experienced volunteers who want to share their knowledge with new hackers and help them get through different roadblocks. They help new hackers make their dreams a reality by helping them during the event. However, mentors do **not** participate at the hackathon like hackers do and therefore, they can’t submit any project.



## Which are my responsibilities as a mentor?

During the event, we expect mentors to:

- Act as helpers, moving from group to group and helping hackers with any questions or roadblocks they have. However, mentors can’t submit a project or contribute in a team’s project in such a way that a project is mainly his/her work. Their task is to guide and help teams to carry on their own projects.
- Help hackers building their team at the team building event, which takes place at the beginning of the hackathon.
- Join HackCU's Slack: <b>[here](https://join.slack.com/t/hackcu/shared_invite/enQtOTM2MDQ2OTY4MDUwLTNlOWQzMmRjMDM4N2UyY2EyZTI0Y2I3ZWFjMTEyNTQ3YzYzOGQyNDUwYjMyMTg2OTI5NzgzNWFhNzY4NmVhYzU)</b>
- Hacking at HackCU V starts at 12.00 P.M on Saturday and ends at 12.00 P.M. on Sunday. We recommend you stay at least 1 hour, however, you can stay as long as you would like! Come at any time that is convenient to you. 
- Check out help requests through our communication channels:
	- Messages from the `#mentors` Slack channel

## What benefits do I get as a Mentor?

We want you to have a great hackathon experience. As a mentor, you will be able to:
- Assist workshops and tech talks that take place during the event.
- Have full meals during the day, including all kinds of snacks and drinks.
- Get exclusive swag of the event: stickers, and sponsors’ merchandising.
