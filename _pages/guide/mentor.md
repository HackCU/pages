---

First of all, in the name of the HackCU team, we’d like to thank you all for wanting to be a mentor. This event would not be complete without you. As a mentor, you will be **helping students work on projects, learn all about a new technology, and come up with creative ideas**. Participants will then have 24 hours to work on any project they choose. HackCU gives participants the resources, space, and time to create something amazing. 


## Who is a mentor?

Mentors are experienced volunteers who want to share their knowledge with new hackers and help them get through different roadblocks. They help new hackers make their dreams a reality by helping them during the event. However, mentors do **not** participate at the hackathon like hackers do and therefore, they can’t submit any project.



## Which are my responsibilities as a mentor?

During the event, we expect mentors to:

- Act as helpers, moving from group to group and helping hackers with any questions or roadblocks they have. However, mentors can’t submit a project or contribute in a team’s project in such a way that a project is mainly his/her work. Their task is to guide and help teams to carry on their own projects.
- Help hackers building their team at the team building event, which takes place at the beginning of the hackathon.
- Join HackCU's Slack: [slack.hackcu.org](https://slack.hackcu.org)
- Hacking at HackCU V starts at 12.00 P.M on Saturday and ends at 12.00 P.M. on Sunday. We recommend you stay at least 1 hour, however, you can stay as long as you would like! Come at any time that is convenient to you. 
- Check out help requests through our communication channels:
	- Messages from the #mentors Slack channel (join slack [here](https://slack.hackcu.org))
	- Requests from the mentors app ([mentors.hackcu.org](https://mentors.hackcu.org/join/mentors)). 
	- Guide for the app: [bit.ly/hackcu_mentorapp](http://bit.ly/hackcu_mentorapp).

- Assist workshops and tech talks that take place during the event.
- Have full meals during the day, including all kind of snacks and drinks.
- Get exclusive swag throughout the event.
