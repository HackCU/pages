## Tasks

During HackCU, Gerard and Mackenzie will be your main point of contact. If they are not around, other main organizers (blue t-shirts) will tell you what to do. The main tasks will be checking in hackers, preparing food when they arrive, giving snacks, attend any hacker, help setting up and help tearing down the venue. In case of doubts, go to HQ (N104) and ask an organizer there.

![Mentor badge](/assets/img/badgementor.png)

![Sponsor badge](/assets/img/badgesponsor.png)

## What happens if I don’t know something?
During the event, hackers will ask you lots of questions, it’s okay if you don’t know the answer. When this happens act cool and let them know you will figure out an answer. You can ask us anytime on the #admin-volunteers slack channel or through the phone.


## Lanyards

Green lanyards are for hackers that are okay with being taken pictures during the event. Black ones are for those that have not accepted.

----

## Hardware Lab
Check hardware using the laptop designated for this task.

During the hacking time, there will be available a Hardware Lab (HL) - placed in Front desk - where hackers can go and ask for hardware devices they will use for their hacking.

In order to process a hardware request, you will have to:

- Go to [https://hardware.mlh.io/](https://hardware.mlh.io/)
- Login using user and password
- Select Manage on HackCU event
- Find the corresponding request (search by hacker name)
- Check the checking-out hardware, collect their ID, click Collect ID and Mark as Checked Out and give hardware

In order to process a hardware return, you will have to

- Go to [https://hardware.mlh.io/](https://hardware.mlh.io/)
- Select Manage on Hackcu event
- Find the corresponding request (search by hacker name)
- Check the checking-in hardware list, check by yourself if hardware is OK, click Return ID and Mark as Checked In and return their ID

**If hacker has already collected hardware and wants more, search for ID and check if it’s the same person with the picture and the name on the badge.**

**If hacker is returning only a part of the collected hardware, don’t return their ID, it has to be returned when he/she has returned all hardware.**

## Code of Conduct

**TL;DR. Be respectful.** Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. You are the forefront image of the hackathon when the organizers are not around. Please try to convey the same attitude we ask our participants to have :)
If anyone has issues, encourage them to come speak with you or an organizer.
