## What happens if I don’t know something?
During the event, hackers will ask you lots of questions, it’s okay if you don’t know the answer. When this happens act cool and let them know you will figure out an answer. You can ask us anytime on the #admin-volunteers slack channel or through the phone.

## Code of Conduct

**TL;DR. Be respectful.** Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. You are the forefront image of the hackathon when the organizers are not around. Please try to convey the same attitude we ask our participants to have :)
If anyone has issues, encourage them to come speak with you or an organizer.
