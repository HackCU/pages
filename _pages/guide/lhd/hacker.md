### Rules :point_left:

**The #1 rule is "Be respectful"**.

Please read [HackCU's code of conduct](https://pages.hackcu.org/code_conduct/) and [MLH's code of conduct](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf). We require all hackers to abide by these rules. Also read the rules of the competition in our [live page](https://live.hackcu.org/rules/).

### Hacking :bulb:

**Hacking will only be available from 9:00AM to 9:00PM**

Local Hack Day is meant as a time for hackers to work on whatever projects they like in a low stress, fun, and collaborative environment. This is a great time for hackers to work on projects from previous events. Itâ€™s a chance to learn a new technology.
