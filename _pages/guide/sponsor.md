HackCU is truly honored to have you sponsor HackCU V this year! This event would not be possible or as successful without you. 
Because of your contribution, you will be helping students work on projects, learn a completely new technology, and come up with great ideas. Students have 24 hours to work on a project of their choice, and HackCU gives students the resources, space, and time to create something amazing.

Participant emails, links, and resumes will be sent to you via email shortly after the event. We will follow-up to request
an email for us to send the data to.


### When to arrive?
If you have a booth for the event, we recommend you arrive between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM to
set up your booth on the first floor of the SEEC building. We recommend you stay at least
from when you arrive until hacking begins at noon. We are having a career fair 
from 11:00 AM to noon.


### Will your logo be on our website?
Yes, of course! If you can, send us an AI or SVG file of your logo so we can use it for our t-shirts.
A good quality PNG will also work. Check out your logo on our website at HackCU.org

You are allowed to send mentors. We recommend they stay for at least one hour, and they are
allowed to come at any time during the event. Check out our [mentor guide](../mentor/). Depending on your tier, you will be able
to send recruiters to the event as well. Please contact your HackCU representative if you are unsure of your tier.

### What do you do with swag?
Participants love company swag! If you have a table, feel free to bring it for your table. If you don't
have a table but still have swag to give out, contact us and we will put it out for you.
