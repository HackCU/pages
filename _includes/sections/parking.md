- Enter promo code **HACK4207**. Total should go down to $0.
- Press **Continue to checkout**.
- Fill all the details asked (including vehicle details).
- Print permit and remember to bring it with you during the event! Don't worry if you forget to do so, we can print the permit at the venue itself as well.

Be sure to follow directions on the signs indicating where you can park. **Parking outside of green areas on the map are not valid for the issued permit!!**
