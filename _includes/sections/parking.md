<!-- Parking will be available in the parking lot outside of SEEC on Discovery Drive. Be sure to follow directions on the signs indicating where you can park. An attendant will be providing parking from **7:00AM to 9:30AM** on Saturday (see green star for their location). If you plan on arriving later than 9:30AM with a car, please let us know by sending an email to [contact@hackcu.org](mailto:contact@hackcu.org). Once the attendant has provided you with a parking pass, you can go in and out parking on the designated areas (on green in the map).
