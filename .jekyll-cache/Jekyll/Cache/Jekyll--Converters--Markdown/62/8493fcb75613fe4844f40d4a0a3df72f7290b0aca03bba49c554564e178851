<h3 id="location-round_pushpin">Location :round_pushpin:</h3>

<p>“Edifici A5 del Campus Nord, C/Jordi Girona, 1-3, 08034 Barcelona”</p>

<p>HackUPC will take place in the buildings A3 to A6 of the Campus Nord of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (Facultat d’Informàtica de Barcelona).</p>

<h4 id="directions-world_map">Directions :world_map:</h4>

<p><strong>From the airport:</strong> Take the L9 line of the metro until the last stop, Zona Universitària. From there, it’s a 5-10min walk until the university. The fare for a single ticket from the airport is 4.60€.
Another option is taking the train from the station in terminal T2 until Sants Estació, then taking the L3 line of the metro until Palau Reial. This combination will cost you 4.40€, but requires a transfer and takes more time.</p>

<p><strong>From the city center:</strong> Take the L3 line of the metro until Palau Reial. From there, it’s a 5-10min walk until the university. The fare for a single ticket is 2.20€
Other options, depending on where are you coming from, are the tram (lines T1, T2 and T3) or the bus (lines 7, 33, 63 among others). The fare for a single ticket in both cases is also 2.20€.</p>

<h3 id="slack-speech_balloon">Slack :speech_balloon:</h3>

<p>Slack is our primary method of communication during HackUPC. Anything you need to know during the event will be announced there, and all members of the staff team are easily found in it (look for the HackUPC logo in the profile picture - that’s us!).
These are some important channels that we have:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>#announcements:</strong> Everything about the event itself will be in this channel: food being served, intro talks starting, activities such as the nerf gun battles, and other important stuff.</li>
  <li><strong>#general:</strong> Talk about HackUPC and get to know fellow hackers.</li>
  <li><strong>#issues:</strong> Something happening in your room? Wi-Fi not working? If you see something wrong during the event, tell us through this channel and we’ll try to solve it as fast as possible.</li>
  <li><strong>#mentors:</strong> If you’re stuck in your project, ask for help here and a mentor will come help you.</li>
  <li><strong>#explore_bcn:</strong> If you’re coming a few days before, or staying after the event to visit Barcelona, this is the channel where you can ask the locals for suggestions about what to visit or where to eat.</li>
  <li><strong>#hackathon_organizers:</strong> Are you a hackathon organizer, or interested in starting one in your college? Meet people like you here!</li>
  <li><strong>#hotel_hosting:</strong> Get recommendations on places to stay in Barcelona. Maybe a local hacker can offer you a bed!</li>
  <li><strong>#team_building:</strong> You still don’t have a team? Have an idea? Share your thoughts here and meet people to form a team.</li>
  <li><strong>#random:</strong> BIENE</li>
</ul>

Please read <a href="https://hackupc.com/code_conduct">HackUPC’s code of conduct</a>. We require all hackers to abide by these rules.</p>

<h3 id="hacking-bulb">Hacking :bulb:</h3>

<p>Hacking is only allowed from 9:00 PM on Friday to 9:00 AM on Sunday! You can start planning your project and setting up your work environment (libraries you may use, IDEs you may need…) before that, but no coding.</p>

<h3 id="need-help-mentors-raised_hand">Need help? Mentors! :raised_hand:</h3>

<p>Please submit your projects on our Devpost by Sunday 13th 9:00 PM. Also remember to opt-in for any sponsor prizes that you are eligible for. Submit early, you can edit your submission later!</p>

<p>Our judging will take place expo style. You’ll present your project to the judges and have 2 minutes to demo what you learned and built. You should still demo your project even if you’re not finished, as our main criteria don’t include finishing it.</p>

<h3 id="travel-reimbursement-airplane">Travel Reimbursement :airplane:</h3>

<p>The processing of travel reimbursements takes some time - our schedule depends on our sponsors’ schedule. We expect to have them sent out in around a month or two. Also, remember that you must submit a project before the deadline in order to get the reimbursement.</p>

<h3 id="sleeping-rooms-zzz">Sleeping rooms :zzz:</h3>
<p>We will have sleeping rooms available for those hackers who may need a rest at night. They will be open from 12:00 PM to 8:00 AM, and we will have air mattresses so that you don’t have to sleep on the floor. Although we provide sleeping masks and ear plugs, please be respectful of other people’s rest when you enter or exit the rooms. 
You will find the sleeping rooms in both floors of building A3 and the second floor of building A4.</p>
