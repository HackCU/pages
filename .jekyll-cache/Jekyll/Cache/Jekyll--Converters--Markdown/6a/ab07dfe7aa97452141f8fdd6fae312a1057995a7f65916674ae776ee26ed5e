<p>Slack is our primary method of communication during HackUPC. Anything you need to know during the event will be announced there, and all members of the staff team are easily found in it (look for the HackUPC logo in the profile picture - that‚Äôs us!).
These are some important channels that we have:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>#announcements:</strong> Everything about the event itself will be in this channel: food being served, intro talks starting, activities such as the nerf gun battles, and other important stuff.</li>
  <li><strong>#general:</strong> Talk about HackUPC and get to know fellow hackers.</li>
  <li><strong>#issues:</strong> Something happening in your room? Wi-Fi not working? If you see something wrong during the event, tell us through this channel and we‚Äôll try to solve it as fast as possible.</li>
  <li><strong>#mentors:</strong> If you‚Äôre stuck in your project, ask for help here and a mentor will come help you.</li>
  <li><strong>#explore_bcn:</strong> If you‚Äôre coming a few days before, or staying after the event to visit Barcelona, this is the channel where you can ask the locals for suggestions about what to visit or where to eat.</li>
  <li><strong>#hackathon_organizers:</strong> Are you a hackathon organizer, or interested in starting one in your college? Meet people like you here!</li>
  <li><strong>#hotel_hosting:</strong> Get recommendations on places to stay in Barcelona. Maybe a local hacker can offer you a bed!</li>
