I"þ<p>The trend in the cybersecurity workforce is scary (or good if you are graduating in this field). There are over 300,000 unfilled positions in cybersecurity today, and by 2021, more than 3.5 million job openings will impact the security posture of enterprise, government, and academic institutions across the globe. We need your help to prepare K-12 students for careers in cybersecurity!</p>

<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>

<p>This challenge asks for your creative ideas in cybersecurity to K-12 students through the use of games. Topics may include encryption, authentication, code hacking, cyber risk, and network analysis and mapping - you are free to choose your own topic related to cybersecurity, as well as topics will be provided.</p>

<p>You are given examples of existing cyber games <a href="https://cybergames.circadence.com/">cybergames.circadence.com</a> to get the creative juices flowing, and your team will embark on programming and/or designing a game/educational tool to include developing the details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Game name and genre</li>
  <li>Learning objectives</li>
  <li>Game mechanics and flow</li>
  <li>Graphics and game design</li>
  <li>Actual game prototype (Unity3D and Unreal games)</li>
</ul>

<p>The end product can be a game that is easily-hackable to teach cybersecurity principles through cheats and hacks, a game or educational tool that teaches cybersecurity principles in general, a report on the above details to be implemented in a future game, any combination of the above, or a closely related idea. Your team is only limited to your creativity, and the end product must be an original creation that furthers the cybersecurity education of Americaâ€™s posterity.</p>

<p>Mentors from CU Boulderâ€™s Technology, Cybersecurity and Policy (TCP) Program and the Department of Computer Science, as well as Circadence, are available to help with idea creation and focus development for your projects. Also, the Cybersecurity Club and Collegiate Cyber Defense Competitionâ€™s student volunteers are willing to assist with your projects should you have the need.</p>
