<h4 id="directions">Directions</h4>

<p><strong>From the airport:</strong> Take the L9 line of the metro until the last stop, Zona Universitària. From there, it’s a 5-10min walk until the university. The fare for a single ticket from the airport is 4.60€.
Another option is taking the train from the station in terminal T2 until Sants Estació, then taking the L3 line of the metro until Palau Reial. This combination will cost you 4.40€, but requires a transfer and takes more time.</p>

<p><strong>From the city center:</strong> Take the L3 line of the metro until Palau Reial. From there, it’s a 5-10min walk until the university. The fare for a single ticket is 2.20€
Other options, depending on where are you coming from, are the tram (lines T1, T2 and T3) or the bus (lines 7, 33, 63 among others). The fare for a single ticket in both cases is also 2.20€.</p>
