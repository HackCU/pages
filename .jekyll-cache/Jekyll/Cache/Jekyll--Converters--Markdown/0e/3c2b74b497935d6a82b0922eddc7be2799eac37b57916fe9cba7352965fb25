<p>Unfortunately, due to university and budget restrictions, we will be <strong>unable to provide a place for you to stay overnight</strong>. You must either remain awake through the night in the venue (campus policy) or find your own accomodations.</p>

<h2 id="flying-in">Flying in</h2>

<p>You should book flights into Denver International Airport (DEN). From there you can take the AB line that runs from the airport directly to campus. The bus schedule and fares can be found <a href="https://www.rtd-denver.com/app/route/AB1-AB2/schedule?direction=westbound">here</a>. You can buy tickets at the airport, paying directly to the driver with cash, or through the <a href="http://www.rtd-denver.com/mobileticket.shtml">RTD Mobile Ticket app</a>. Also, make sure to bring $9.00 cash for the bus ride back to the airport as there are no ticket machines where you can pay with card near our campus. Keep your bus receipts so we can reimburse you later if you were approved for reimbursement.</p>

<p>From the airport, take the <a href="https://www.rtd-denver.com/app/route/AB1-AB2/schedule?direction=westbound">AB line</a> (Westbound) Downtown Boulder Station line and get off at the <strong>Broadway &amp; Euclid</strong> stop near the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>
