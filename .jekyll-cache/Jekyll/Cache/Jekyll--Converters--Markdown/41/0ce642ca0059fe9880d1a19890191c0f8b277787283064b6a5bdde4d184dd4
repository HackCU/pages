I"Å<p>First of all, in the name of the HackCU team, weâ€™d like to thank you all for wanting to be a mentor. This event would not be complete without you. As a mentor, you will be <strong>helping students work on projects, learn all about a new technology, and come up with creative ideas</strong>. Participants will then have 24 hours to work on any project they choose. HackCU gives participants the resources, space, and time to create something amazing.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-a-mentor">Who is a mentor?</h2>

<p>Mentors are experienced volunteers who want to share their knowledge with new hackers and help them get through different roadblocks. They help new hackers make their dreams a reality by helping them during the event. However, mentors do <strong>not</strong> participate at the hackathon like hackers do and therefore, they canâ€™t submit any project.</p>

<h2 id="which-are-my-responsibilities-as-a-mentor">Which are my responsibilities as a mentor?</h2>

<p>During the event, we expect mentors to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Act as helpers, moving from group to group and helping hackers with any questions or roadblocks they have. However, mentors canâ€™t submit a project or contribute in a teamâ€™s project in such a way that a project is mainly his/her work. Their task is to guide and help teams to carry on their own projects.</li>
  <li>Help hackers building their team at the team building event, which takes place at the beginning of the hackathon.</li>
  <li>Join HackCUâ€™s Slack: <a href="https://slack.hackcu.org">slack.hackcu.org</a></li>
  <li>Hacking at HackCU IV starts at 12.00 P.M on Saturday and ends at 12.00 P.M. on Sunday. We recommend you stay at least 1 hour, however, you can stay as long as you would like! Come at any time that is convenient to you.</li>
  <li>Check out help requests through our communication channels:
    <ul>
      <li>Messages from the #mentors Slack channel (join slack <a href="https://slack.hackcu.org">here</a>)</li>
      <li>Requests from the mentors app (<a href="https://mentors.hackcu.org/join/mentors">mentors.hackcu.org</a>).</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="what-benefits-do-i-get-as-a-mentor">What benefits do I get as a Mentor?</h2>

<p>We want you to have a great hackathon experience. As a mentor, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assist workshops and tech talks that take place during the event.</li>
  <li>Have full meals during the day, including all kind of snacks and drinks.</li>
  <li>Get exclusive swag throughout the event.</li>
</ul>
